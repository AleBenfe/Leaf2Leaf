# Leaf2Leaf

Python code for Leaf2Leaf architecture described in 

A. Benfenati, D. Bolzi, P.Causin and R. Oberti, *A Deep Learning Generative Model Approach for Image Synthesis of Plant Leaves*

The code is based on Tensorflow and Keras.

The repositoty has 3 directories:

- [ResVae](https://github.com/AleBenfe/Leaf2Leaf#resvae)
- pix2pix
- Leaf2LeafTranslation

## ResVae

The Residual Variational AutoEncoder for the leaf skeleton generation is in RES_VAE.ipynb. The trained model described in the paper is saved in the `Results` directory. The code is tailored for being used also on Colab.

The result of the pretrained model is downbelow
